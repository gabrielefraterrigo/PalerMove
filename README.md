## Overview

PalerMove is a full-stack car and scooter sharing application designed to facilitate vehicle reservation for users and service management for administrators.  
The system aims to make car-sharing services **accessible, safe, and user-friendly**, providing options such as driver-assisted rentals and verification of valid driver licenses.

The architecture follows a **Client-Server model**. Client nodes represent user devices accessing the service, and all data is managed centrally. Communication between nodes is handled via **HTTP**.

- **Backend:** NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL, JSON Web Token (JWT), Bcrypt  
- **APIs:** Mapbox (for reverse geocoding and mapping features)
